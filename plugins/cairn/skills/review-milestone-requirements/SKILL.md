# review-milestone-requirements

The current "work in progress" requirements for the planned milestone live in two documents of the current milestone directory: `requirements.md` (the prose — goal, relevant starting state, decisions, out of scope) and `open_questions.xml` (one `<open-question>` block per question still open). The overall goal is to make that requirements set ready enough for the work to begin.

This skill is the **repeatable engine** of the requirements-iteration loop — run it each time around:

```
review → (discuss) → answer → review → answer → … → converged → derive-tasks
```

Each pass does three jobs: **reconcile** the existing questions against what's now decided, **surface** the new gaps, and report whether the requirements have **converged**.

Every write this skill makes to `open_questions.xml`, and every listing of its blocks, is a call to the plugin's open-question tool, `python3 ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/tools/open_questions.py <subcommand> <MILESTONE_DIR> …`, written out in full on every call, never through a variable, alias, or function of your own defined to stand for the command or any part of it — the tool is that file's sole writer and owns the document's escaping and layout: a mutator prints nothing on success, `list` prints bare ids one per line, and any failure is one `Error: <reason>` line on stderr with a non-zero exit and the document left unchanged. Reading the document whole to reason over it is the one thing done directly, with the file-reading tool. Never edit `open_questions.xml` yourself.

## Milestone requirements document structure

`requirements.md` is prose Markdown in four sections:
```md
# Milestone <milestone_id>: <name>

## Goal

<description of the goal here>

## Relevant starting state

<description of the Relevant starting state>

## Decisions

<subsections with detailed requirements>

## Out of Scope

<what the milestone deliberately leaves out>
```

The open questions live beside it in `<MILESTONE_DIR>/open_questions.xml` — one `<open-question id="Short Title">` block per question under a single root, each holding a `<question>` child and, once the recommend sweep has annotated it, `<alternative>`, `<applied-principle>`, `<depends-on>`, and `<recommendation>` children. No question block is ever placed inline in `requirements.md`.

## Workflow

### 0. Find the current milestone

Follow `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/get-current-milestone.md` to resolve `<MILESTONE_DIR>`. Never use a hardcoded path.

### 1. Read the documents and take inventory

Read `<MILESTONE_DIR>/requirements.md` and `<MILESTONE_DIR>/open_questions.xml` in full with the file-reading tool. That whole read is for reasoning only — every listing of the blocks and every change to the question document below is a tool call. Build a mental inventory of three things, because the rest of the pass plays them against each other:

- the **Decisions** already recorded (what's settled),
- the **`<open-question>` blocks** already present (what's still flagged),
- every stated requirement, constraint, and assumption.

### 2. Reconcile the existing question set

This is the step that makes the skill loop-aware: the documents have been edited since questions were last raised, so the existing blocks may be stale. Tidy them — but only with evidence, and never by answering:

- **Prune a settled block** — remove an `<open-question>` block **only when you can point to an entry already in `## Decisions` that covers it**. This is cleanup of cascade-misses and manual drift, not answering. If you can't cite the covering decision, do not remove it.
- **Dedup repeats** — when two blocks ask materially the same thing, keep the clearest one and remove the other.
- **When in doubt, flag — don't delete.** If a block *looks* answered but no recorded decision clearly covers it, leave it in place and note it in your report as "possibly resolved — confirm". Silently dropping a still-live question destroys tracked state; that's the one outcome to avoid.

Each removal, on either path, is one bare call — no `--option`, since a prune or dedup records nothing:

```
python3 ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/tools/open_questions.py remove <MILESTONE_DIR> "<Short Title>"
```

In that one write the tool deletes the block and strips every block whose embedded pick depended on it — and every block that depended on those in turn — of its `<recommendation>`, `<depends-on>`, and `<applied-principle>` children, keeping its `<alternative>` children, so no `<depends-on>` tag is left naming a removed or stripped block; a stripped block stays in the document as a live question, its alternatives intact, for the next `/recommend-all-open-questions` pass to re-pick. Stripping decides nothing, records nothing under `## Decisions`, and adds nothing to the step-5 report — the committed diff is its record.

You **never** record a decision, fold an answer into `## Decisions`, or otherwise resolve a question here. Recording answers belongs to `/answer-open-question` alone. This step only shapes the question set to match decisions that already exist — removing settled or repeated blocks, and with them the analysis that depended on them.

### 3. Surface new gaps

Now look for questions the documents don't yet capture — paying special attention to gaps the most recent decisions just **exposed** (a settled decision often raises a fresh downstream choice). For each requirement, ask:

- Is the expected behavior fully specified, or does it leave choices ambiguous?
- Are there edge cases not addressed?
- Are there dependencies on systems not yet described?
- Are there constraints implied but not stated?

Add only genuinely new questions — don't re-raise anything already present (you just inventoried them in step 1), and do not invent requirements: only annotate gaps relative to what is already written.

Author each new finding as one `add` call, the question text as its heredoc body:

```
python3 ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/tools/open_questions.py add <MILESTONE_DIR> "<Short Title>" <<'EOF'
<Question text here.>
EOF
```

The tool appends the block after the existing ones and owns its shape — escaping, indentation, and the fold of the text to one line — so you write plain text, no XML and no entities. What you author is the two judgments the block carries:

- **The question text.** Because a block does not sit next to the requirement it concerns, **each question must stand on its own** — brief, self-contained, and question-shaped, fully understandable without the surrounding context, never a design proposal. And **each question asks one choice**: a gap that holds two choices becomes two questions, one per choice. The one exception is choices in one gap that constrain each other, so that not every pairing of them is viable — author those as a single multi-axis question that asks both choices at once.
- **The Short Title** (the block's `id`): a 2–5 word phrase that uniquely identifies the question within the document (e.g. "Getting-started section order", "Glossary term scope"). It is the stable handle the question is cited by in conversation and located by in the answering and recommendation skills, which match it **case-insensitively** — so keep every Short Title unique across all blocks even ignoring case. The tool refuses an id an existing block already carries (its `Error:` line names it); pick a distinct title and call again.

Do not restructure or rewrite existing content — `requirements.md` is not edited by this pass, and the question document changes only through the `remove` calls of step 2 and the `add` calls here.

### 4. Commit the reshaped requirements

Read and follow the shared commit procedure at `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/commit-procedure.md`, carrying out its steps yourself. Supply it these two inputs:

- **PATHS** — this skill's own change set, the milestone's two requirements documents: `<MILESTONE_DIR>/open_questions.xml` (where every prune, dedup, and new block of this pass landed) and `<MILESTONE_DIR>/requirements.md`.
- **SUBJECT** — `Requirements-review: <milestone_id>`.

The shared procedure owns the no-op guard, the path-scoped staging, and the commit. Its dirty-own-path guard covers this skill's no-op case: a pass that reconciled, pruned, and surfaced nothing leaves both files unchanged, so nothing is staged and nothing is committed; a pass that reshaped the question set commits that reshaping.

### 5. Report convergence

Run

```
python3 ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/tools/open_questions.py list <MILESTONE_DIR>
```

It prints the Short Title of every `<open-question>` block still in the document, one per line in document order; empty output is a converged document. That print — not your recollection of the pass — is what the two items below are read from.

On the success path, print exactly one fixed terse status line — `Requirements reviewed.` — carrying no identifier (no milestone id, no count, no commit subject). Do **not** re-narrate what the pass reshaped: there is no "What changed this pass" summary (blocks pruned, repeats merged, new questions raised, "possibly resolved — confirm" flags) and no handoff pointer toward `/discuss-open-question` or `/answer-open-question`.

Follow that terse line with only the two pieces of decision-critical state git never captures, so the user knows whether to loop again or move on:

- **What's still open** — the Short Titles `list` printed, one per line. No nudge pointer.
- **Convergence** — `/derive-tasks` requires that **no `<open-question>` block remains**, which is exactly an empty `list`. So:
  - If `list` printed anything → the requirements are **not** ready; the next loop step is to answer them, then re-run this skill.
  - If it printed nothing → say explicitly that the requirements look **ready for `/derive-tasks`**.

**No-op pass.** When the step-4 dirty-own-path guard fires — this pass reconciled, pruned, and surfaced nothing, so both files are unchanged and nothing was committed — do **not** print `Requirements reviewed.` Instead print a single distinct line stating that nothing changed and briefly why (e.g. "No changes — the question set already matched the recorded decisions and no new gaps surfaced."). Still report the still-open list and convergence verdict above, since that state is unchanged but the user still needs it to decide the next loop step.
