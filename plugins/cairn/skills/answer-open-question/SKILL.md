# answer-open-question

Resolves a named open question of the current milestone by recording the user's answer as a decision in `requirements.md`, removing the answered block from `open_questions.xml`, propagating the answer's implications through both, and committing those edits on their own with the decision's rationale in the commit body — establishing the `Manual-answer:` commit that `/capture-milestone-principle-updates` later reads, alongside `Alternative-answer:` and `Recommendation-answer:` commits, when it distills a milestone's answers into reusable principles: a manual answer is an override signal (a decision the recommender did not make), so its body rationale is what gets distilled. The answer text is recorded **literally**; the one reserved answer text is the retired sentinel `record the recommendation`, which this skill redirects instead of recording (step 2).

## Usage

```
/answer-open-question <Short Title>. <answer text>
```

The `<Short Title>` must match (case-insensitive, against the block's `id`) an existing `<open-question>` block. The `.` character is the separator. Everything after the first `.` is the answer.

**Example (literal answer):**
```
/answer-open-question Getting-started section order. Use approach B — open the "Draft the Getting Started section of the user guide" deliverable with the install-and-run walkthrough, then follow it with the conceptual overview, so a new reader reaches a working setup before the background material.
```

**Example (retired sentinel — redirected, records nothing):**
```
/answer-open-question Getting-started section order. record the recommendation
```

## Workflow

### 1. Parse the input

Split the skill args on the first `.` character:
- Before: the question **Short Title** (trim whitespace)
- After: the **answer text** (trim whitespace)

If no `.` is found, report a parse error and show the expected format.

### 2. Redirect guard for the retired sentinel

Compare the parsed answer text — **trimmed and lowercased** — against the retired sentinel `record the recommendation`, as an **exact whole-string match** (never a substring: an answer that merely *contains* those words is a literal answer, not the sentinel). This is a pure string comparison on the parsed text — no milestone resolution, no file read.

- **Exactly the sentinel — redirect and stop:** recording a question's embedded recommendation lives in `/answer-open-question-with-recommendation`. **Stop without recording or committing anything** and print a redirect message telling the user to record the recommendation via `/answer-open-question-with-recommendation <Short Title>` instead (or to answer with literal text here via `/answer-open-question <Short Title>. <answer text>`).
- **Anything else — literal-answer path:** the parsed answer text *is* the `ANSWER`. Carry it forward to the recording in step 4.

### 3. Find the current milestone

Follow `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/get-current-milestone.md` to resolve `<MILESTONE_DIR>`. Never use a hardcoded path. Hold `<MILESTONE_DIR>` — you need it for the delegated recording and the commit.

### 4. Record the answer

Read and follow the shared answer-recording procedure at `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/answer-procedure.md`, carrying out every step **yourself, in this conversation**. Pass it the `<MILESTONE_DIR>` resolved in step 3, the **Short Title** parsed in step 1, and the **answer text** resolved in step 2 as its `MILESTONE_DIR`, `SHORT TITLE`, and `ANSWER` inputs, and pass **no `RECORDED OPTION`** — a literal answer lifts no option id, so the core forms its one judgment itself: whether the answer plainly settles on one of the answered block's own alternatives.

That procedure owns the locate / analyse / fold / remove / cascade recording, every read and write of `<MILESTONE_DIR>/open_questions.xml` in it a call to the plugin's open-question tool. If the Short Title matches no block, the core's `locate` call fails and it stops without changes — relay the tool's `Error:` line, which lists the ids the document holds, so the user can retry.

### 5. Commit the manual answer

Read and follow the shared commit procedure at `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/commit-procedure.md`, carrying out its steps yourself. Supply it these three inputs, using the `<MILESTONE_DIR>` resolved in step 3:

- **PATHS** — this skill's own edits: `<MILESTONE_DIR>/open_questions.xml` and `<MILESTONE_DIR>/requirements.md`.
- **SUBJECT** — exactly `Manual-answer: <Short Title>` (the answered question's handle). The marker is the provenance `/capture-milestone-principle-updates` reads when it walks a milestone's answer commits across all three subjects: `Manual-answer:` and `Alternative-answer:` mark override signals it distills new principles from, while `Recommendation-answer:` marks evidence about existing principles only.
- **BODY** — the decision's rationale — but record only rationale that genuinely exists in this conversation. Never prompt the user for a rationale and never fabricate one. When `/discuss-open-question` deliberation is in context, the body captures that reasoning. On a cold answer (no deliberation), the body is the literal answer text — recorded verbatim, including any inline "because" clause the user typed; when the answer states no reasoning, the body holds the bare decision. The answer string is itself the cold path's rationale affordance — add no separate rationale prompt.

That procedure owns the path-scoped staging, the dirty-own-path no-op guard, and the commit. Its no-op guard also covers this skill's clean-stop cases: if step 4 stopped on the tool's `Error:` line, step 2's redirect guard fired on the retired sentinel, or step 1 hit a parse error, neither file changed, so nothing is staged and nothing is committed.

### 6. Report findings

On the success path — the answer was recorded and committed — print exactly one fixed terse status line, carrying no identifier (no Short Title, no commit subject):

```
Answer recorded.
```

Do **not** re-narrate which question resolved or how the documents changed (the removed block, the decision folded into `## Decisions`, the cascading resolutions). Alongside the terse line keep only the one piece of genuinely git-absent advisory output: any new open questions the answer may have introduced — surface these but do **not** add them to the document without user confirmation.

**No-op case:** if step 5's dirty-own-path guard fired — nothing was committed because neither file changed (a step 1 parse error, the step 2 retired-sentinel redirect, or a step 4 stop on the tool's `Error:` line) — do **not** print the terse success line. Instead print a single line stating that nothing was recorded and briefly why.
