# complete-all-tasks

Pure orchestrator. Reads the current milestone's task list and spawns one isolated subagent per task, each with a clean context and exactly one task to complete. Never complete a task directly here, even as a fallback when a subagent fails.

## Invocation

```
/complete-all-tasks
```

No arguments required.

## Workflow

### 0. Find the current milestone

Follow `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/get-current-milestone.md` to resolve `<MILESTONE_DIR>`. Never use a hardcoded task-list path.

### 1. Read the task list

Read `<MILESTONE_DIR>/TASKS_TODO.md` and confirm it has at least one `##` section. If the file is empty or has no `##` sections, report that the task list is empty and stop.

### 2. For each task (top to bottom)

Repeat the following loop until no tasks remain:

#### 2a. Identify the next task

Re-read `<MILESTONE_DIR>/TASKS_TODO.md` to get the current top task — the first `##` heading in the file. Do not cache the task list across iterations, since each completed task is removed.

#### 2b. Spawn a subagent to complete the task

Use the `spawn_agent` tool to spawn one default (generic) subagent, with no custom agent type, and a prompt that tells it to read and follow the plugin's `complete-task` agent file at `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/complete-task.md` and otherwise contains only the task name, substituting `<TASK_NAME>` with the exact `##` heading text (without the `##` prefix):

```
Read and follow the agent instructions in ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/complete-task.md.

Complete the task named: "<TASK_NAME>"
```

Wait for the agent to return.

- If the agent reports FAILED, stop the loop, report the task name and the failure reason to the user, and stop. Do not proceed to 2c.
- If the agent returns without an explicit DONE or FAILED status (e.g. it returned early, produced no output, or gave an ambiguous result), treat this as FAILED. Report what was returned, stop the loop, and do not proceed to 2c. **Never attempt to complete the task yourself as a fallback.**
- On `DONE`, the agent has already **staged** its task's change set path-scoped — the paths it created or edited, plus the two milestone task-list files. You commit that staged index in 2c; you stage nothing yourself and the agent hands back nothing to collect.

#### 2c. Commit the staged change set

After the subagent returns `DONE` (success confirmed, the task moved to `<MILESTONE_DIR>/TASKS_DONE.md`, and its change set staged), commit **the index the agent staged**. Stage nothing here yourself — the agent already did the path-scoped staging, so never `git add` and never `git add -A`:

1. **No-op guard.** Check whether anything is actually staged (for example `git diff --cached --quiet`). If nothing is staged, this task produced no committable change: commit nothing, create no empty commit (there is no `--allow-empty` here), and go on to 2d.
2. **Commit.** Commit the staged index under the subject `Task-completion: <TASK_NAME>`, where `<TASK_NAME>` is the exact `##` heading text step 2b already holds — `git commit -m "Task-completion: <TASK_NAME>"` with no pathspec, since the staged index is exactly this task's change set.

Commit once per task.

#### 2d. Continue

Go back to 2a and process the next task.

### 3. Report completion

On the success path, when `<MILESTONE_DIR>/TASKS_TODO.md` contains no more `##` sections, print exactly one fixed terse status line for the whole run — `All tasks completed.` — and nothing more: no list of the tasks that were completed and no next-step pointer.

If the run committed nothing — every per-task commit in step 2c hit its no-op guard, so nothing was staged across the whole run — do not print the terse success line; instead print a distinct one-line message stating that nothing changed and why (nothing was committed this run).
