# Complete-task procedure (shared core)

This is the single source of truth for completing one named task from the current
milestone's task list: the `complete-task` skill follows these steps inline, the
`complete-task` agent follows them in isolation. The wrappers add their own framing; this
file describes only the work itself. If a step fails, diagnose the root cause with the
available tools, fix it, and retry — never skip a step or record partial work as done.

## The task shape

A task section in `TASKS_TODO.md` is **brief-level** — the format
`${PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/task-format.md` defines: a `##` title heading, a 1–3 sentence
description of what is to be achieved, why the milestone needs it, and how it would be
verified, then a trailing `---` separator. That is the whole task.

Two things follow, and they shape this entire procedure:

- **The task carries no acceptance criteria.** You derive the formal acceptance bar
  yourself, from the task description plus the milestone's `requirements.md` (step 2), and
  that derived bar — not anything authored in the task — is what step 4 verifies against
  and what step 5 records.
- **The task carries no forward contract.** Tasks run in order, so whatever an earlier task
  was to produce already exists: resolve every cross-task reference by reading that prior
  task's **live deliverable** in the project, never by trusting a name the task list
  promised.

Read the whole section body as ordinary description. Whatever a given section happens to
contain — including a heading, label, or bullet list left over from an older task list — is
prose feeding the bar you derive; no part of a task body gets privileged parsing.

## Project context

The project being worked on documents its environment in the workspace root `AGENTS.md`
(and `README.md`): the project's domain context, working conventions, available tools, and
how work is verified as done. This procedure reads that file; it never assumes a particular
kind of work.

## Procedure

### 1. Find and read the task

Follow `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/get-current-milestone.md` to resolve `<MILESTONE_DIR>`.

Read `<MILESTONE_DIR>/TASKS_TODO.md`. Locate the `##` section whose heading matches the
given task name (case-insensitive, partial match is fine). If no section matches, **stop
without changing anything** and report that no matching task was found, listing the
available `##` headings so the caller can retry. Do not carry out anything that is not a
task in `TASKS_TODO.md`.

Read the located section in full, from its `##` heading to its trailing `---`. Its
description is the statement of intent — what is to be achieved, why, and how it would be
verified — and every sentence of it is input to the acceptance bar you derive next.

### 2. Load the work environment and derive the acceptance bar

Read the workspace root `AGENTS.md` and hold in context:

- The project's domain context — what the project is and the material it works with.
- Working conventions — the practices to follow while doing and finishing the work.
- Available tools — what tools exist and what they are for.
- How work is verified as done — the checks that confirm a deliverable meets its bar.

Read `<MILESTONE_DIR>/requirements.md` and hold in context the milestone's goal, its
relevant starting state, and its recorded decisions. This is what tells you what "done"
means for this task beyond the brief's own sentences — a decision recorded there is binding
on the work, and any value, name, or threshold it fixes is authoritative.

Then **derive the task's acceptance bar**: turn the task description plus what
`requirements.md` binds for it into an explicit list of concrete, checkable criteria. Each
criterion must be an observable property of a deliverable — something you can confirm by
reading an artifact, running a named command, or inspecting the project — not a restatement
of the intent. Cover what the description asks for and nothing wider: the bar is the task's
definition of done, so it must not import scope the task did not ask for, and it must not
drop a "how it would be verified" clause the description states. Where the bar depends on
something a prior task produced, read that live deliverable now and let what it actually
contains — its real names, structure, and values — fix the criterion.

Hold that derived bar in context verbatim. It is the gate step 4 checks against and the
record step 5 appends to the `TASKS_DONE.md` entry, so it must not drift between here and
there.

### 3. Carry out the task

**Uncommitted changes already in the tree may be a previous run's partial work.** A run of
this procedure can be resuming an earlier one that failed or was interrupted part-way, which
leaves its partial work uncommitted in the working tree. Before editing anything, inspect
what is already uncommitted: whatever bears on this task is work already done — read it,
continue from it, and carry its paths in the running list below — rather than redoing or
reverting it. Uncommitted changes that do not bear on this task are not yours to touch.

**The task gives you the goal, not a procedure — you own the design.**
Derive the flow yourself from the task's description and the acceptance bar you derived in
step 2, then translate it into concrete edits: the exact files and where within them the
work lands, the precise wording, the structure. Ground every decision in the live material
you are changing (read the real artifacts you are touching) and in the conventions from
`AGENTS.md`, not in assumptions.

Resolve anything a sibling task was to provide the same way — by reading that task's live
deliverable in the project and building against what is really there. Since tasks run in
order, the deliverable is the contract; a name recalled from another task's description is
not.

If the goal leaves genuine ambiguity, resolve it the way the description, the derived
acceptance bar, and `requirements.md` most plausibly intend — the derived bar is your
target; whatever satisfies it faithfully is correct. Do not pause to widen scope or invent
requirements the task did not ask for.

**After creating or modifying any file**, follow the finishing conventions documented in
`AGENTS.md`. At minimum, apply the project's way of verifying the change and fix any
problems before continuing.

**Record the paths you touch.** As you create or edit each file while carrying out the
task, keep an explicit running list of those paths — recorded as each edit is made, never
reconstructed afterwards by diffing the working tree. This recorded set is the task's real
change set.

**Tool patterns:**
- Read or edit a file: `Read` then `Edit`.
- Run a shell command: `Bash`.
- MCP-based operations: use the MCP tool documented in `AGENTS.md` that matches the goal.

### 4. Verify against the derived acceptance bar

Take the acceptance bar you derived in step 2 and verify the deliverable against it,
criterion by criterion, however the project's conventions define done. If `AGENTS.md`
documents a done-verification convention (a check, review, or command that confirms work is
complete), apply it. When it defines no such convention, fall back to direct inspection of
the deliverable against the derived bar, checking it criterion-by-criterion using whatever
means each criterion itself names — read the artifact, or run a command only where a
criterion specifies one.

For each criterion:

- Deliverable-content criteria: check the artifact's contents with `Read`.
- Command-output criteria: run the specified command via `Bash` and check the output.
- Structural criteria: use `find` or `Bash` to confirm the expected artifacts exist where expected.
- MCP-based criteria: use the relevant MCP tool documented in `AGENTS.md`.

Do not proceed to step 5 until every criterion passes.

### 5. Move the task TODO → DONE, augmented with the bar

The move is a **move-plus-augment**: the finished entry records both the brief and the bar
the work was actually verified against.

1. `Read` `<MILESTONE_DIR>/TASKS_TODO.md`.
2. `Edit` it to remove the completed `##` section and its trailing `---` separator. The
   section starts at the `##` heading line and ends at (and includes) the next `---` line.
3. `Read` `<MILESTONE_DIR>/TASKS_DONE.md`.
4. `Edit` it to append the completed section, preserving existing content: append the `##`
   heading and the task body, then — inside that same section, under the description and
   above the closing `---` — the derived acceptance bar as a `**Verified:**`-labeled bullet
   list, one bullet per criterion, in the order you verified them:

   ```markdown
   ## <heading>

   <body>

   **Verified:**

   - <criterion 1, as verified>
   - <criterion 2, as verified>

   ---
   ```

   Write the criteria as they stood when they passed in step 4 — the same bar, neither
   re-derived nor summarized into prose.
