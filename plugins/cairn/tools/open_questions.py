"""The only writer of a milestone's existing open_questions.xml, the open-question document.

Usage: python3 <plugin root>/tools/open_questions.py <subcommand> MILESTONE_DIR [...]

define_milestone.py creates the empty document together with its milestone directory; from
then on this module is the document's only writer. Every subcommand takes the
already-resolved milestone directory as its first argument and acts on the one file this
module writes inside it, MILESTONE_DIR/open_questions.xml, which must already exist: no
subcommand creates it. The caller resolves the milestone; this module never reads
milestones/README.md.

Subcommands:
  list MILESTONE_DIR [--without-alternatives] [--without-recommendation] [--with-question]
      print the id of every <open-question> block, one per line in document order;
      --without-alternatives keeps only the blocks carrying no <alternative> element and
      --without-recommendation only the blocks carrying no <recommendation> element, a
      block printed under both flags only when it carries neither; --with-question changes
      only the line shape, printing each selected block as its id, a single tab, then its
      <question> text, and composes with either filter or both, which select exactly as
      they do without it
  locate MILESTONE_DIR SHORT_TITLE...
      print each named block verbatim, as the document holds it, in the order named
  lift MILESTONE_DIR SHORT_TITLE [--alternative ALTERNATIVE_ID]
      print the block's answer text on one line: "<option> — <rationale>" from its
      <recommendation option="…">, or with --alternative "<id> — <what-it-is>" from the
      named <alternative id="…"> with its <advantage>/<drawback> children excluded
  add MILESTONE_DIR SHORT_TITLE
      append a bare block — the wrapper and its one <question> child — whose id is the
      Short Title and whose question text is the body read from standard input; an id an
      existing block already carries is refused
  strip MILESTONE_DIR [--recommendation] SHORT_TITLE...
      delete every child but <question> from each named block — its <alternative>,
      <applied-principle>, <depends-on>, and <recommendation> elements — leaving the
      wrapper and <question> intact; with --recommendation delete only the <recommendation>,
      <depends-on>, and <applied-principle> elements and leave the <alternative> elements
      standing; either way no other block is touched, so a <depends-on> tag that names a
      stripped block stays where it is, and a block holding nothing the call would delete is
      left as it is
  embed MILESTONE_DIR SHORT_TITLE (--alternatives | --recommendation)
      put one half of a block's children into the named block, the half the required flag
      names: the whole message carrying them is the body read from standard input, the
      fragment is sliced out of it (the identity on a clean message, discarding a grounding
      summary or closing remark otherwise), parsed, validated — no <open-question> or
      <question> line, no text outside its elements, no element of a kind the format does
      not define, no element of the other half, and never the order of its children — and
      written as that half of the block's children, the other half's elements left exactly
      as the block holds them and the whole block placed in the canonical child order the
      document format below states; every miss, the two extraction misses included, is one
      Error line. With --alternatives the block must carry no
      <alternative> yet (bare strip is the hatch), the slice runs from the first line
      holding "<alternative" through the last line holding "</alternative>", and the
      fragment must hold at least one <alternative>. With --recommendation the block must
      already carry at least one <alternative> and no <recommendation> yet (strip
      --recommendation is the hatch), the slice runs from the first line holding
      "<applied-principle", "<depends-on", or "<recommendation" through the last line
      holding "</recommendation>", the fragment must hold exactly one <recommendation> whose
      option names one of the block's own <alternative> ids, and every
      <depends-on question="…" option="…"/> must resolve one hop to another block of the
      document that carries <alternative> elements and to one of that block's <alternative>
      ids — so the alternative set the first shape embedded stays frozen under the second
  remove MILESTONE_DIR SHORT_TITLE [--option RECORDED_OPTION]
      delete the named block and, before the one write, reconcile the blocks that depend on
      it: with --option (the option recorded as the answer, which must be one of the removed
      block's own <alternative> ids or the call is refused with the document unchanged) a
      surviving block whose <depends-on> names the removed id with that same option loses
      only that tag, and every other block whose <depends-on> names the removed id is
      stripped as by strip --recommendation, keeping its <alternative> elements; without
      --option every such block is so stripped; either way the strip runs transitively over
      the blocks that depend on a stripped block, so no <depends-on> tag is left naming a
      block removed or stripped by the call
  walk MILESTONE_DIR
      print the id of every block carrying a <recommendation>, one per line in the order the
      answer sweep dispatches them: those blocks are gathered in document order, each one's
      <depends-on question="…"> values are edges to the gathered block that id names (an edge
      naming a block that is absent or carries no <recommendation> is dropped, so a block left
      with no edge is an origin), and the blocks are placed origins first, then every block
      whose every edge names a block already placed, same-depth ties in document order, a
      stranded remainder (a cycle) broken by promoting its document-order-first block to an
      origin; a document with no such block prints nothing
  sort MILESTONE_DIR
      rewrite the document with the blocks carrying a <recommendation> first, in exactly the
      order walk prints them, and every block carrying none last, in its prior document
      order — so on a sorted document walk prints exactly the annotated prefix of list; a
      document already in that order is left as it is, and no other subcommand reorders
      blocks

A Short Title names a block by its id, ALTERNATIVE_ID names an alternative by its id, and
RECORDED_OPTION names an alternative by its id too; all are compared against the document's
un-escaped values, case-folded.

A free-text body (the question text of add, the message embed slices its fragment from) travels
on standard input, never as an argument: the tool reads sys.stdin.buffer to end of file
exactly once per call and decodes it as UTF-8 itself, and it refuses a terminal stdin so a
call that forgot to pipe its body (a quoted heredoc, a redirected file) fails instead of
blocking.

Document format, the canonical form every write re-renders the whole document into:
  - a bare <open-questions> root with no XML declaration and no attributes; the empty
    document is that one root element, written self-closing
  - the <open-question> blocks in the order the document already holds them: add appends,
    and only sort reorders
  - one element per line, indented two spaces per depth: the root at column 0, each
    <open-question id="Short Title"> at 2, its children at 4, and inside an alternative
    the what-it-is text, <advantage>, and <drawback> at 6
  - each block's children grouped by kind: a block carrying a <recommendation> in the
    order <question>, <applied-principle>, <depends-on>, <recommendation>, the one
    <alternative> whose id the recommendation's option names, then the other <alternative>
    elements in their relative order — an option naming none of them promotes nothing, the
    alternatives keeping their relative order after the recommendation; a block carrying
    none in the order <question>, the <alternative> elements (in their relative order),
    <applied-principle>, <depends-on>; the order written is the alternatives' relative order
    from then on, so a later strip --recommendation keeps it; inside an alternative the
    what-it-is text, then every <advantage>, then every <drawback>
  - every text and attribute value folded to one line: whitespace runs collapsed to one
    space, ends trimmed
  - an element with neither text nor children written self-closing as <tag/>
  - the five predefined entities (&amp; &lt; &gt; &quot; &apos;) substituted in element
    text and attribute values alike
  - UTF-8, LF line ends, one trailing newline

Output and error contract:
  - a read prints only the bare, un-escaped values the caller needs, one per line; a line
    carrying two values (list --with-question) separates them with a single tab, which no
    value can contain since every write folds whitespace runs to one space; an empty
    result set is empty stdout with exit status 0
  - a mutator prints nothing on success
  - every failure is exactly one line "Error: <reason>" on stderr with exit status 1, and
    a non-zero exit leaves the document byte-for-byte unchanged; a malformed invocation
    gets argparse's own usage message and exit status 2; no traceback ever reaches the
    caller

Standard library only; runs on Python 3.9 and later.
